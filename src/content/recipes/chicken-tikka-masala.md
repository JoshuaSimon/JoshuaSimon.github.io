## Instructions

### Step 1: Marinate the Chicken

In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well.

Add the chicken chunks and toss to coat thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

### Step 2: Cook the Chicken

Preheat your grill or broiler to high heat. Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water first).

Grill the chicken for 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Step 3: Make the Sauce

In a large skillet or pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft and golden.

Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant, stirring constantly to prevent burning.

### Step 4: Add Tomatoes and Spices

Add the canned tomatoes and the remaining tablespoon of garam masala. Break up the tomatoes with your spoon. Simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.

For a smoother sauce, use an immersion blender to puree the mixture, or transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Return to the pan.

### Step 5: Add Cream and Chicken

Reduce heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Season with salt to taste. Let the sauce simmer for 5 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the skewers and add to the sauce. Stir gently to coat the chicken. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

### Step 6: Serve

Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with basmati rice and warm naan bread.

## Tips

- For a smokier flavor, add a small piece of charcoal to the pan: heat it until red hot, place it in a small bowl in the center of the curry, drizzle with ghee, cover immediately, and let smoke for 2-3 minutes
- Adjust the spice level by increasing or decreasing the cayenne pepper
- Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) can be added for extra authenticity
- The sauce can be made ahead and reheated when ready to serve
