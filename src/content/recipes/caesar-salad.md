## Instructions

1. **Make the Croutons (Optional)**: If making homemade croutons, cut day-old bread into cubes. Toss with olive oil, salt, and garlic powder. Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 10-12 minutes until golden and crispy.

2. **Prepare the Dressing**: In a large wooden bowl (traditional method), mash the garlic and anchovies together with a fork until they form a paste. Add a pinch of salt to help break them down. Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard. Whisk together until well combined.

3. **Emulsify the Dressing**: While whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the olive oil in a thin, steady stream. The dressing should become thick and creamy, similar to mayonnaise. If it's too thick, add a teaspoon of warm water to thin it out. Add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce if desired. Season with black pepper to taste.

4. **Prepare the Lettuce**: Wash the romaine lettuce and dry thoroughly using a salad spinner or clean kitchen towels. Tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces, discarding the tough stem ends.

5. **Assemble the Salad**: Add the lettuce to the bowl with the dressing (or toss the dressing with the lettuce in a large serving bowl). Toss gently but thoroughly to coat all the leaves. Add half of the grated Parmesan cheese and toss again.

6. **Serve**: Transfer to serving plates or a large platter. Top with the remaining Parmesan cheese and croutons. Add extra black pepper if desired. Serve immediately while the croutons are still crispy.

## Tips

- Raw eggs can carry salmonella risk. Use pasteurized eggs if concerned, or substitute with 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise
- Quality anchovies make a big difference - look for salt-packed or high-quality oil-packed varieties
- Don't skimp on the Parmesan - use a vegetable peeler to create large shavings for extra flavor
- For a complete meal, top with grilled chicken breast or shrimp
- The dressing can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator
