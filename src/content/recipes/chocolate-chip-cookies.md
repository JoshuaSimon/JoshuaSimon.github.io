## Instructions

### Step 1: Preheat and Prepare

Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

### Step 2: Cream Butter and Sugars

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar using an electric mixer on medium speed. Beat for 2-3 minutes until the mixture is light and fluffy.

### Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract until fully incorporated.

### Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

### Step 5: Mix the Dough

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Don't overmix - the dough should be thick and slightly sticky.

Fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts if using) with a wooden spoon or spatula until evenly distributed.

### Step 6: Shape the Cookies

Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 5cm apart. Each cookie should be roughly 3-4cm in diameter.

For uniform cookies, you can roll the dough into balls and slightly flatten them.

### Step 7: Bake

Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly underdone. The cookies will continue to cook on the baking sheet after being removed from the oven.

### Step 8: Cool and Serve

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy warm with a glass of cold milk!

## Tips

- For extra flavor, brown the butter before using it (let it cool to room temperature first)
- Add a sprinkle of sea salt on top right after baking for a sweet-salty combination
- Chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking helps prevent spreading and creates thicker cookies
- Use a mix of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks for varied texture
- For perfectly round cookies, use a round cookie cutter to shape them immediately after removing from the oven
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days
