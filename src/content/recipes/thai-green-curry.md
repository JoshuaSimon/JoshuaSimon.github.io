## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients

Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Slice the bell pepper and quarter the eggplant. Have all ingredients measured and ready - this dish cooks quickly.

### Step 2: Fry the Curry Paste

Heat the vegetable oil in a large wok or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the green curry paste and fry for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant. The paste should darken slightly and release its aromatic oils.

### Step 3: Add Coconut Cream

Add about half of the coconut milk (the thick cream from the top of the can). Stir well to combine with the curry paste. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes until the oil begins to separate from the coconut milk.

### Step 4: Cook the Chicken

Add the chicken pieces to the curry. Stir to coat in the curry mixture and cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside.

### Step 5: Add Liquids and Seasonings

Pour in the remaining coconut milk and chicken stock. Add the fish sauce, palm sugar, and torn kaffir lime leaves. Stir well and bring to a gentle simmer.

### Step 6: Add Vegetables

Add the eggplant, bell pepper, and bamboo shoots. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through. Stir occasionally.

### Step 7: Final Touches

Taste and adjust the seasoning with more fish sauce (for saltiness), sugar (for sweetness), or lime juice (for acidity). The curry should have a balance of salty, sweet, and slightly sour flavors.

Add the Thai chilies if using, and stir in the Thai basil leaves. Remove from heat.

### Step 8: Serve

Serve hot over steamed jasmine rice. Garnish with extra Thai basil leaves and sliced red chilies if desired.

## Tips

- For a vegetarian version, substitute chicken with tofu or mixed vegetables and use soy sauce instead of fish sauce
- Fresh curry paste is always better than jarred, but good quality jarred paste works well too
- Kaffir lime leaves add authentic flavor but can be omitted if unavailable
- Don't boil the curry vigorously - a gentle simmer prevents the coconut milk from separating
- The curry tastes even better the next day as the flavors develop
- Add a handful of cherry tomatoes for extra freshness and color
- For a richer curry, use only coconut milk and omit the stock
