## Instructions

### Step 1: Make the Dough

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy. Add the flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until a rough dough forms.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be soft and slightly tacky.

### Step 2: First Rise

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

### Step 3: Cold Fermentation (Optional but Recommended)

Punch down the dough and divide it into 2-3 portions. Shape each into a ball and place in separate containers. Cover and refrigerate for 24-72 hours for better flavor development.

### Step 4: Prepare the Sauce

Crush the San Marzano tomatoes by hand in a bowl. Add minced garlic, a pinch of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Mix well. Do not cook the sauce - it will cook on the pizza.

### Step 5: Prepare the Cheese

Drain the fresh mozzarella and tear it into small pieces. Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

### Step 6: Shape the Pizza

Remove the dough from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat your oven to its highest temperature (ideally 250-280°C / 480-535°F) with a pizza stone inside for at least 30 minutes.

On a floured surface, gently stretch the dough into a round circle about 30cm in diameter. Don't use a rolling pin - use your hands to preserve the air bubbles.

### Step 7: Assemble and Bake

Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce, leaving a 2cm border. Add torn mozzarella pieces evenly across the pizza.

Carefully transfer the pizza (with parchment) onto the hot pizza stone. Bake for 8-12 minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.

### Step 8: Finish and Serve

Remove from the oven and immediately top with fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Add a pinch of sea salt. Let cool for 2 minutes before slicing.

## Tips

- A pizza stone or steel makes a huge difference in achieving a crispy crust
- Less is more with toppings - don't overload the pizza
- The dough should be stretched, not rolled, to keep the air bubbles
- If your oven has a broiler, use it for the last minute to get leopard spots on the crust
