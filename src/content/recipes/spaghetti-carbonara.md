## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients
Beat the eggs in a bowl and mix in the grated Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses. Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.

### Step 2: Cook the Pasta
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.

### Step 3: Cook the Pancetta
While the pasta is cooking, cut the pancetta into small cubes. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pancetta until crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat.

### Step 4: Combine Everything
Add the hot drained pasta directly to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to coat in the rendered fat. Remove the pan from heat.

### Step 5: Add the Egg Mixture
Working quickly, pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta. Toss vigorously and continuously for about 1 minute. The residual heat will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. Add reserved pasta water, a little at a time, if needed to achieve a silky consistency.

### Step 6: Serve
Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and black pepper on top.

## Tips

- Never add cream to carbonara - it's not traditional!
- The key is timing - the pasta should be hot enough to cook the eggs but not so hot that they scramble
- Quality ingredients make all the difference, especially the cheese and cured meat
- Work quickly once the pasta is cooked to prevent the eggs from scrambling
